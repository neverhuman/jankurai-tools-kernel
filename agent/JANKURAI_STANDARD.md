# jankurai Standard Agent Bootstrap

Standard version: `0.9.0`
Published: `2026-05-12`
Full standard: `docs/agent-native-standard.md`
Version manifest: `agent/standard-version.toml`
Paper: `Jankurai: A Versioned Repository Conformance Standard for Trustworthy AI-Assisted Merge`
Public thesis line: `No proof, no merge; no receipt, no trust.`

## Prime Directive

Optimize for agent-verifiable engineering. Reject wrong code fast, localize failure, repair narrow scope, and leave evidence.

Target stack:

- Rust core
- TypeScript/React/Vite product surface
- PostgreSQL durable truth
- generated contracts
- exception-only Python AI/data service, only when an advanced ML/data library
  has no practical Rust, TypeScript, or service alternative

Implementation default: use Rust for repository tools, core logic, proof lanes,
and automation whenever practical. Agents must not create or expand Python for
repo tooling, proof lanes, product services, general backend glue,
authorization, or PostgreSQL access. The only allowed Python exception is rare:
advanced ML/data work that depends on a Python-only library, is boxed under
`python/ai-service`, and has a dated exception with owner, expiry, proof lane,
and a migration/containment plan.

## Start Ritual

Before edits:

- read this file
- read `docs/agent-native-standard.md` when policy detail matters
- inspect `agent/owner-map.json`
- inspect `agent/test-map.json`
- inspect `agent/generated-zones.toml`
- inspect `agent/standard-version.toml` for versioned artifacts
- inspect `agent/tool-adoption.toml` when rolling out new Jankurai-backed tool lanes
- check target file length before adding behavior
- search for existing owner and duplicate behavior

Do not edit outside the requested ownership scope.

## Central Operating Index

This file is the short bootstrap every future agent must treat as the central
router. Keep root `AGENTS.md` brief; put durable operational detail in this file
or linked docs and keep executable truth in machine-readable manifests.

Source-of-truth order:

1. `AGENTS.md`: entrypoint and repository-specific constraints.
2. `agent/JANKURAI_STANDARD.md`: central agent bootstrap, hard blocks, rule IDs,
   proof rules, and command index.
3. `docs/agent-native-standard.md`: full standard and target-stack doctrine.
4. `agent/owner-map.json`: ownership routing for every changed path.
5. `agent/test-map.json`: proof command routing for every changed path.
6. `agent/proof-lanes.toml`: named proof lanes, covered rules, artifacts, and
   command allowlist.
7. `agent/generated-zones.toml`: generator-only outputs and regeneration
   commands.
8. `agent/tool-adoption.toml`: optional tool lanes and CI-backed replacement
   evidence.
9. `agent/zyal/**/*.zyal`: canonical checked-in ZYAL runbooks. The only
   allowed non-runbook file in that tree is `agent/zyal/README.md`, and legacy
   `.zyal.yml` / `.zyal.yaml` files are audit findings.
10. `docs/testing.md`: detailed testing, UX, security, proofbind, proofmark,
   migration, history, and conformance command behavior.
11. `docs/artifact-contracts.md` and `schemas/`: JSON/TOML artifact contracts.

Operational surfaces:

- CLI surface: `cargo run -p jankurai -- --help` and
  `crates/jankurai/src/main.rs`; implementation modules live under
  `crates/jankurai/src/commands/`.
- Installed release binary: before trusting release scores, badge state, or CI
  parity, refresh the repo-local binary with
  `cargo install --path crates/jankurai --locked --force`, then verify
  `which jankurai`, `jankurai version`, `jankurai versions`, and
  `jankurai badge --link agent/jankurai-badge.json --update-readme --check`.
- Canonical recipes: `Justfile`; prefer `just fast`, `just score`,
  `just conformance`, `just paper`, and `just check` over ad hoc command
  guesses.
- Conformance evidence: `conformance/README.md`,
  `conformance/fixtures/*/jankurai-fixture.toml`, and
  `target/jankurai/conformance-results.{json,md}`. The generated paper table is
  `paper/tex/generated/conformance_results_table.tex` and must be regenerated
  by `just conformance`, not hand-edited.
- Paper layout: canonical release source is `paper/jankurai.tex` plus
  `paper/tex/`; generated paper tables live under `paper/tex/generated/`.
  Companion Markdown is context, not the TeX generator source. Preserve the
  title-page image offset in `\JankuraiPlacedHeader`; the subtitle should not
  repeat the Jankurai name because the image already carries it.
- Badge and paper publication: README badge state is generated from
  `agent/badge.toml`, the tracked accepted baseline under
  `agent/baselines/`, and the installed `jankurai` binary. Ignored
  `.jankurai/repo-score.*` files are local generated outputs and must not be used
  as public badge or ratchet sources. The README citation block must link to
  `paper/jankurai.pdf`. Public
  repository scan tables are generated from the tracked source JSON and must
  not reference external run roots or tip filenames in paper artifacts.
- Release governance: coding projects need a release control surface before
  release or publish claims are credible. At minimum, keep a version source,
  changelog, release process doc, release automation or command policy,
  checksum/provenance/SBOM evidence policy, and rollback guidance. Dangerous
  release automation routes through `HLT-037-RELEASE-BAD-BEHAVIOR` and the
  `language-bad-behavior` lane.
- Receipts: write volatile proof artifacts under `target/jankurai/`; append
  durable phase receipts under `tips/phases/logs/` only when the active plan
  requires it.

Interaction default: explain material scope changes, run the smallest credible
lane from `agent/test-map.json`, then run broader lanes when the changed surface
or user request needs them. Never rely on chat history as the only record of a
tool, test, layout rule, or proof result.

## Conformance

Only repositories claiming jankurai conformance are bound by these levels:

| Level | Gate |
| --- | --- |
| `HL0` | unscored or unrouted |
| `HL1` | advisory audit |
| `HL2` | guarded critical caps |
| `HL3` | standard score floor plus high/critical blocking |
| `HL4` | ratchet against regression |
| `HL5` | release contract across audit, tests, security, contracts, DB, e2e, and versions |

## Hard Blocks

Stop or fix first when any condition is true:

- no root `AGENTS.md` or equivalent agent instructions
- no one-command fast validation
- path has no owner-map entry
- path has no test-map entry
- agent-authored audit masking hides tracked Rust/core files, broad source
  roots, generated-zone policy, ignore lists, or post-audit
  `caps_applied`/`findings`/`issues` output
- non-generated file exceeds hard LOC max without an exception
- generated file would need hand edit
- public API/schema changes without contract regeneration
- UI, exception-only Python, or domain code writes product truth directly
- Python is added without an approved advanced-ML/data exception
- Python owns product authorization, product truth, proof lanes, repo tooling,
  general backend glue, or production DB writes
- new silent fallback, broad catch, disabled test, or duplicate behavior
- product/runtime code contains future-hostile markers without allowlisted docs/generated/vendor/product-copy context or dated exception
- paper sources must not mention `tips/*.txt` file names; refer to corpus, row-family, or source-group labels instead
- high-risk change lacks security lane
- generated code changes auth/input/crypto/filesystem behavior without security proof
- secret-like values, prompt transcripts, MCP config, fixtures, or logs expose credentials or customer data
- trusted agent/tool policy contains prompt-injection, bypass, or overbroad permission language
- destructive migration lacks rollback, backfill, lock, and DB proof evidence (`HLT-021-DESTRUCTIVE-MIGRATION` when destructive SQL is present without documented safety markers documented in `docs/testing.md`)
- release-capable project lacks version source, changelog, release process doc, release automation or command policy, checksum/provenance/SBOM policy, and rollback guidance
- release automation mutates tags or assets, skips proof, publishes mutable alias-only outputs, packages secret-bearing files, or omits artifact integrity evidence
- tests are skipped/focused/tautological/snapshot-only for changed behavior
- agent tool permissions are broader than the requested lane
- user-facing UI changes lack artifact-backed rendered UX proof on critical surfaces

| `HLT-047-CANONICAL-README` | README drifts from the canonical agent-native shape (AGENTS.md link, target stack, badge, quick-start) (advisory, experimental) |
| `HLT-048-CANONICAL-CI-GAP` | CI drifts from the canonical local-parity shape (`ops/ci/*.sh` delegation, pinned action SHAs, jankurai audit lane) (advisory, experimental) |

`HLT-029-RUST-BAD-BEHAVIOR` is detector-backed now. `HLT-030` through `HLT-043` are detector-backed catalog IDs in the bad-behavior family. `HLT-044-WORKTREE-SPRAWL` (see [Ownership Boundaries](#ownership-boundaries)) and `HLT-045-GENERATED-ZONE-GOVERNANCE` (see [Generated Zones](#generated-zones)) are advisory experimental governance guards that stay off the hard-cap path until each is promoted with its own cap. `HLT-046-UNNECESSARY-VARIETY`, `HLT-047-CANONICAL-README`, and `HLT-048-CANONICAL-CI-GAP` (see [Jankurai Pillar: Variety and Canonical Shape](#jankurai-pillar-variety-and-canonical-shape)) are the advisory experimental Jankurai-pillar guards and also stay off the hard-cap path until promoted.

## Jankurai Pillar: Variety and Canonical Shape

The Jankurai pillar adds three advisory guards that reward consistency and a
canonical agent-native shape. All three are medium-severity, experimental, and
carry no hard cap, so they never block or lower a green repository's score.

- `HLT-046-UNNECESSARY-VARIETY` flags redundant *variety* where consistency is
  expected: the same `enum`/`const`/`static` defined in two or more active-source
  modules with diverging shapes. It reuses the copy-code token normalization,
  defers byte-identical copies to the copy-code lane, and is gated by
  `[variety] min_instance` (default 2) so a single occurrence never fires.
- `HLT-047-CANONICAL-README` checks that the root README links `AGENTS.md`,
  states the target stack, carries a status/score badge, and offers a quick-start
  section. No README means no finding.
- `HLT-048-CANONICAL-CI-GAP` checks that CI delegates to versioned `ops/ci/*.sh`
  scripts, pins every `uses:` action to a full 40-character commit SHA, and runs a
  jankurai audit lane. No workflows means no finding.

Thresholds and toggles live under `[variety]` and `[canonical]` in
`agent/audit-policy.toml`.

## Ownership Boundaries

| Layer | Owns | Never owns |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `apps/web` | UI, forms, generated clients, browser tests | secrets, durable truth, core authz, direct DB |
| `apps/api` | HTTP/RPC edge, extraction, response mapping | domain rules, raw SQL decisions |
| `crates/domain` | IDs, invariants, pure decisions | IO, env, time, random, DB, framework types |
| `crates/application` | commands, authz, idempotency, transactions | UI, external protocol details |
| `crates/adapters` | DB, queue/streaming clients, external APIs, filesystem, env | domain rules, event schema ownership |
| `crates/workers` | jobs, backpressure, workflow glue | product truth outside application |
| `contracts` | OpenAPI/protobuf/JSON Schema and generated clients | handwritten drift |
| `db` | migrations, constraints, indexes, RLS | app-only durable invariants |
| `python/ai-service` | exception-only advanced ML/data library work behind typed boundaries | product truth, authz, production DB writes, proof lanes, repo tools, general backend glue |
| `ops` | CI, OTel, SBOM, SCA, secrets, provenance | hidden manual gates |

## Generated Zones

Never hand-edit generated files. Change source contract and regenerate.

Generated files must declare:

```text
Generated by: <tool> <version>
Source: <contract path>
Command: <regen command>
DO NOT EDIT BY HAND.
```

Structured generated artifacts that cannot legally carry comments, including
`.jankurai/repo-score.json` and native lockfiles such as `package-lock.json`, must
carry equivalent machine-readable identity in their native schema. Required
identity includes generator/schema metadata and version fields for reports, or
the package-manager lockfile shape for lockfiles.

## Proof Lanes

Use `agent/test-map.json` to select the smallest credible lane.

Required lane names:

- `fast`: deterministic local proof under 2 minutes
- `contract`: public API/schema compatibility
- `db`: migrations, constraints, tenant/data rules
- `db-migration-analyze`: migration liability report (`jankurai migrate . --analyze --json target/jankurai/migration-report.json`); used when `agent/test-map.json` routes `db/migrations/` changes
- `web`: component/type/rendered UX behavior
- `e2e`: critical browser journeys
- `security`: secrets, dependencies, unsafe, SBOM/SCA
- `observability`: traces, request IDs, structured errors
- `audit`: jankurai JSON/Markdown report
- `release`: all merge gates

Tool replacement counts only when a Jankurai lane runs in CI and uploads the expected artifact evidence. Local config is readiness only; it does not count as replacement proof.

Coverage evidence is proof support, not a score category. Line coverage is reachability; mutation, property, integration, API, DB, UX, accessibility, and container evidence are stronger behavior signals. Missing optional coverage tools cannot block merge, while required proof gaps on changed critical surfaces route to the existing HLT rule for that surface.

## Audit Output

Every audit should produce JSON and Markdown with:

- `standard_version`
- `auditor_version`
- `schema_version`
- `paper_edition`
- `target_stack_id`
- raw and final score
- hard caps
- dimension breakdown
- `profile_structure`
- tool adoption readiness and replacement evidence
- findings with evidence
- ordered `agent_fix_queue`

The Markdown report includes a `## Reference Profile Structure` section that summarizes detected cells, canonical folders, local guidance status, and migration steering.

## Repair Receipts

For non-trivial fixes, leave enough evidence for the next agent:

- changed paths
- failed rule or lane
- proof command
- artifact versions
- screenshot, crop, trace, ARIA snapshot, or audit report paths when UI or browser behavior changed
- remaining exception or follow-up

Operational receipts from `doctor`, `init`, and phase closeouts belong under `target/jankurai/receipts/` and should be cited by path when they matter.

Plotting integrations should use bounded history commands, such as `jankurai history export` or `jankurai score trend`, for score plots. Do not scrape full audit JSON when a bounded history command exists.

## User-Provided Plans

When the user provides a paper, release, implementation, or handoff plan in the
conversation, treat that plan as controlling. Do not route it through local phase
or master-plan files unless the user explicitly names those local files. Before
broad validation, run `jankurai lane` or `jankurai proof` against changed paths
to choose the smallest credible proof lane. For audit requests, run
`cargo run -p jankurai -- . --json .jankurai/repo-score.json --md .jankurai/repo-score.md`.

## Kickoff Route

Use `jankurai kickoff` as the no-write intake step for new user intent.
It should write only `target/jankurai/kickoff.json` and
`target/jankurai/kickoff.md`, surface read-first files, ownership boundaries,
proof lanes, clarifying questions, stop conditions, expected receipts, and
next commands, and hand the task to `context-pack` only after the repo facts
are visible.

## Local Commands

```bash
jankurai kickoff . --intent "<change request>" --out target/jankurai/kickoff.json --md target/jankurai/kickoff.md
jankurai versions
just versions
just fast
just score
cargo run -p jankurai -- copy-code . --json target/jankurai/copy-code.json --md target/jankurai/copy-code.md
just paper
just check
just ci-doctor   # verify local toolchain matches CI
just ci          # run every CI lane locally
```

`jankurai upgrade` is write-capable; use `jankurai upgrade --score` to run the
post-upgrade scoring lane.

## CI Local Parity

`HLT-042-CI-LOCAL-PARITY` enforces a deterministic, locally reproducible CI
contract so failures are caught before push, not first on GitHub.

Requirements:

1. **Single source of truth.** CI commands live in versioned shell scripts
   under `ops/ci/*.sh`. `.github/workflows/*.yml` files are thin orchestration
   that set up the runner and call `bash ops/ci/<lane>.sh`.
2. **Local runner.** `scripts/ci-local.sh` exposes the same lanes locally and
   delegates to the same `ops/ci/*.sh` scripts (no hand-maintained
   approximation).
3. **Doctor.** `scripts/ci-doctor.sh` reports every tool the CI lanes need so
   contributors can verify their environment matches CI.
4. **Pinned toolchain.** `rust-toolchain.toml`, `.tool-versions`, and the
   pinned versions in `ops/ci/lib.sh` (cargo install versions, action SHAs,
   Node version) keep local and remote environments identical.
5. **Artifact assertions.** Each `ops/ci/*.sh` lane checks that every expected
   artifact path exists before exiting, so missing outputs fail locally too.
6. **Container parity.** `ops/ci/Dockerfile.ci` provides an ubuntu image
   matching the GitHub-hosted runner; `ops/ci/run-in-container.sh` (or
   `just ci-container`) runs any lane inside it so runner-specific issues
   are reproducible offline.
7. **Mandatory pre-push gate.** `ops/git-hooks/pre-push` runs the same
   `ops/ci/quality-gates.sh` script CI runs, so it is impossible to push
   code that will redden the fast lane. `just bootstrap` wires the hook
   via `git config core.hooksPath ops/git-hooks`. Bypasses require
   `JANKURAI_SKIP_PREPUSH=1` and an incident note.

The audit emits `HLT-042-CI-LOCAL-PARITY` when a workflow inlines commands,
when a referenced script is missing, when the runner/doctor/`ops/ci/lib.sh`
shim is absent, when a Rust workspace lacks `rust-toolchain.toml`, or when
`ops/git-hooks/pre-push` is missing.

`HLT-043-COPY-PASTE-BAD-BEHAVIOR` covers exact active-source file copies and
same-name semantic unit copies across different active files. The copy-code
lane is advisory for warning-only areas such as tests, fixtures, stories,
config, Docker, and migrations, but hard active-source duplicates are never
excused.

### Copy-Code Hard-Fail Scope (v1.3)

The copy-code lane intentionally narrows its hard-fail surface to two
inexcusable classes:

1. **Exact file duplicates** in active source (`CopyCodeKind::ExactFile`).
2. **Same-name function/method copies** across two or more active-source files
   (`CopyCodeKind::ExactUnitSameName`) that clear `min_lines >= 10` and
   `min_tokens >= 100`.

All other detections (`ExactUnitDifferentName`, `TokenBlock`) are advisory
regardless of scanner severity and are surfaced as volume-ranked warnings only.
This narrow scope is enforced at finding-emit time via
`CopyCodeClass::hard_fail`. To widen the hard-fail surface, modify
`audit/copy_code.rs::effective_severity_for`.

## v0.5 Daily Merge Loop

```bash
jankurai kickoff . --intent "<change request>" --out target/jankurai/kickoff.json --md target/jankurai/kickoff.md
jankurai context-pack . --changed <path> --max-tokens 6000 --out target/jankurai/context-pack.json --md target/jankurai/context-pack.md
jankurai prove . --changed <path> --plan-out target/jankurai/proof-plan.json --plan-md target/jankurai/proof-plan.md
jankurai audit . --mode advisory --json target/jankurai/repo-score.json --md target/jankurai/repo-score.md
jankurai witness . --changed-from origin/main --baseline agent/baselines/main.repo-score.json --out target/jankurai/merge-witness.json --md target/jankurai/merge-witness.md
```

Ratchet mode requires an accepted baseline. Merge witness is the PR receipt:
no proof, no merge; no receipt, no trust.
