[![Jankurai score: 89/100](agent/jankurai-badge.svg)](agent/jankurai-badge.json)
<!-- jankurai-badge:end -->

Historical score from the committed [baseline report](agent/baselines/main.repo-score.json)
and [auditor metadata](agent/jankurai-badge.json).

Shared audit substrate for the **jankurai** auditor and the Jankurai standard.
This repository ships one crate, `jankurai-audit-kernel` (model, scan, rules,
caps, boundaries, validation, render), extracted from `jankurai-core` so the
core CLI and sibling tools depend on one kernel. It is one member of the Jankurai
split family; read [`SPLIT.md`](SPLIT.md) for the family contract and
[`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for agent routing rules.

## Contributor setup

This repository supplies shared inventory, findings, boundary rules and report models to
[Jankurai](https://github.com/neverhuman/jankurai). For binary installation,
your first audit, and the complete family build, start at the hub.

Install Rust **1.97.1**, a native compiler/linker and Node.js **24** for CI
control tests. Then run the crate's contributor checks:

```sh
cargo fetch --locked
cargo test --workspace --locked
bash scripts/ci-local.sh required
```

The native library does not need Node.js at runtime. The complete quality lane
also needs the pinned security tools and auditor installed by the owning CI
setup; see [testing](docs/testing.md) and
[the workflow](.github/workflows/ci.yml). Local recipes are in the
[Justfile](Justfile).
